My research focuses on enhancing the efficiency of AI models, particularly on edge devices. I leverage approximation theory to design novel AI structures that are not only effective but also computationally efficient. My current interest lies in the rapid feedforward processing of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). I am currently a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), under the supervision of Professor Rui Tan and co-supervision of Professor Wang Lilian. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics from Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
